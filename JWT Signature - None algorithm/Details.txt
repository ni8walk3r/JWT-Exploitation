# Vulnerability:
JWT supports a None algorithm for signature. This was probably introduced to debug applications. However, this can have a severe impact on the security of the application.

None algorithm variants:

none
None
NONE
nOnE

#Exploitation:
To exploit this vulnerability, first decode the JWT and change the algorithm used for the signature, change the values in payload section and the remove the signature. Base64 encode the header & payload section, separate them by using dots. Then submit your new JWT.
