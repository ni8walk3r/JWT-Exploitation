# Vulnerability:
JWT supports a None algorithm for signature. It is used to debug applications. However, this can have a severe impact on the security of the application.

# Usuage:
The script can be used in the following manner:
1) Download the jwt.rb file
2) Run it by giving following command: `ruby jwt.rb`
3) Enter the JWT token and value of the claim you want to make changes in
4) A new modified JWT token will be created, use it for further exploitation

This issue can be manually exploited in the following way:
1) Decode the JWT token
2) In Header Section change the algorithm used for the signature to none 
3) Change the values of claim present in the Payload Section
4) Then remove the Signature Section from the token
5) Base64 encode the header & payload section and join them by using dots. Remember to add a dot after the Payload section
6) Then use the new JWT token for further exploitation
