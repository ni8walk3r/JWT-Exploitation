# Vulnerability: 

The integrity of the token relies on the strength of the secret used to sign the token. If an attacker can find the secret, he will be able to forge her own malicious token. 

# Usage:

First we have to bruteforce the "secret" key used to compute the signature:
1) We have to convert the JWT token in the format that [John the Ripper] (https://www.openwall.com/john/) can understand, for that we will be using jwtcrack tool:
``


The script can be used in the following manner:

    Download the jwt.rb file
    Run it by giving following command: ruby jwt.rb
    Enter the JWT token and value of the claim you want to make changes in
    A new modified JWT token will be created, use it for further exploitation
